# Vibe_O_Clock, what a cool name, right? LOL

I initially released it for the Japanese-speaking world under the name "Shin World Clock" (Wow, what a lame name! I was inspired by "Shin Godzilla" and "Shin Evangelion"! Or rather, it was meant as an homage to Director Anno).
But I wanted VibeCoders around the world to use it, so I made it global (it compiled in just a few minutes!).
I think it's pretty useful, so I want everyone to use it! I'd love it if you could clone the app's code!
